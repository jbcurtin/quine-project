# Quine&#x3a; Our pledge to a multinational community

## Agreement and format of communication between languages

### English
Our agreement to format is intended to create a welcoming atmosphere to those who are not yet comfortable communicating with English.

Taking an iterative approach, all contributers are expected to conduct themselves in fairest manor possible. Our community is ran primarily with English, this can become overwhelmingly fustrating for non-native English speakers. To reduce irregular animosity, please use the [Language Bridge](/language-bridge/) to align emotions where language would naturally fail.

#### Code of Conduct
We abide by the CoC introduced by PSPython. Please read over our [Code of Conduct](https://www.pspython.com/pages/code-of-conduct/).

### Non-English Speakers
